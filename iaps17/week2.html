            <ol>
                <li>Are knowledgeable about the kind of work you are proposing (Do your research)</li>
                <li>Have put considerable thought into the scope of your proposed project (Plan &amp; schedule)</li>
                <li>Already possess the majority of the skills needed to see the project through (Exercise your current skillset)</li>
