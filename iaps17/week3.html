            <h2>FIRST PROJECT: PRESENTATIONS</h2>
            <p>Everyone will need to give a 5-10 minute talk, detailing their plans for the first project.</p>
            <p>This will be worth 5% of your final grade in this class and will be evaluated on its content, preparation, and delivery.</p>

            <p>Your presentation should demonstrate that you:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Are knowledgeable about the kind of work you are proposing (Do your research)</li>
                <li>Have put considerable thought into the scope of your proposed project (Plan &amp; schedule)</li>
                <li>Already possess the majority of the skills needed to see the project through (Exercise your current skillset)</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>PRESENTATION CONTENT</h2>
            <p>The presentation must include:</p>

                <li>A working title, plus your name</li>
                <li>A concise and compelling description of what you want to make</li>
                <li>Examples of sketches, prototypes, or other preliminary materials which are visual or aural</li>
                <li>1 example of work previously made by you (collaborative work ok!) which is relevant to your project</li>
                <li>5 examples of work created by others which consider successful and are relevant to your project (artwork, sound, design, games, etc.)</li>
                <li>5 examples of research done into the subject matter, themes, or concepts of your project (NOT artwork, sound, design, games, etc.)</li>
                <li>A brief outline of the schedule for the project which provides specific weekly goals</li>
            </ol>
